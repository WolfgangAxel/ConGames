# Family Feud!
A simple Python program to manage playing a "Family Feud"-style game with two teams. Probably best used for larger groups of people, such as a party or convention.

## Requirements
Linux OS (potential for cross-platform eventually maybe), Python 2.7.11, and the csv, math, and Tkinter Python libraries.

##How To
To create a board, Fill in the array of text fields with your answer in the left box and the point value in the right. When you are ready to play, press the "make board" button to open a new window with the board. Display this on a secondary monitor or projector. As contestants guess answers that appear on the board, pressing "show" will add points to the pot, shown in the top-middle of the game board. To assign the points in the pot, click the "add points" button above the manual score correction boxes.

##Future work
Adjust font settings to make it visible on larger screens (change size on-the-fly?), add cross-platform support maybe
