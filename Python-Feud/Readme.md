# Python Feud!
A simple Python program to manage playing a "Family Feud"-style game with two teams. Probably best used for larger groups of people, such as a party or convention. Should be 100% cross platform!

## Requirements
The csv, math, and Tkinter Python libraries (built on Python 2.7.11).

##How To
To create a board, Fill in the array of text fields with your answer in the left box and the point value in the right. When you are ready to play, press the "make board" button to open a new window with the board. Display this on a secondary monitor or projector. As contestants guess answers that appear on the board, pressing "show" will add points to the pot, shown in the top-middle of the game board. To assign the points in the pot, click the "add points" button above the manual score correction boxes.

##Possible future work
- Add a "Fast Money" final round like in the show
