# ConGames
A collection of games I've made to be played with a larger group of people, like at a convention, with 1-2 people leading the event

These *should* be cross-platform, however I make no gaurantees. These were built on Python 2.7.11, and require some combination of the Tkinter, math, os, time, csv, glob, and PIL Python modules.
